The Django DataTables library provides a reusable Django application to easily
integrate the DataTables jQuery plugin into a project.

It is currently in the design and planning stage.

To get started with the test_project, use the following commands to setup your
test database and run the development server:

    cd test_project
    ./manage.py syncdb --migrate
    ./manage.py loaddata fortunecookies
    ./manage.py runserver

Then connect to http://localhost:8000/ to view the sample datatable.
